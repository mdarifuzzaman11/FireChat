## Description

What I Learned During the Build: Sockets, Rest APIs, Sending Images, React Hooks, Props, and CSS!

With online statuses, great design and functionality, icons telling you who read the message,
image support, sound notifications, the ability to create multiple rooms, and much more, 
I have also used PWA to modify the Web App and Turn into a PWA (progressive web application) and can be downloaded as an Nativ Web App.
